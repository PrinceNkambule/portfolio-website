Learning Curve: Understanding ASPX pages and Bootstrap was initially overwhelming, but it laid a solid foundation for future projects.
Successes:

Foundation Skills: Gained fundamental skills in building static web pages, responsive layouts, and basic styling with Bootstrap.
What I Learned:

ASPX and Bootstrap became my stepping stones, helping me grasp web design principles and front-end development essentials.
4. Application Development: Image Reader App
Stack: ASP.NET MVC, Azure Cognitive Services (OCR), Azure API Management, site.css
Description: This app extracts text from images using Azure Cognitive Services and handles efficient cloud-based communication via Azure API Management. A responsive front end styled with site.css enhances usability.

Challenges:

Azure Integration: Working with Azure Cognitive Services and API Management was new for me, but it was rewarding to see the OCR feature perform accurately in real-time.
API Management: Configuring Azure’s API Management to handle OCR requests efficiently took careful setup and optimization.
Successes:

Real-Time OCR Functionality: The app performs text extraction from images with high accuracy, making it a powerful tool for document digitization.
Responsive Design: Created a layout that adapts seamlessly to mobile devices, enhancing accessibility and usability.
What I Learned:

Developed skills in integrating cloud services, particularly for AI-driven applications.
Gained experience in managing cloud APIs and enhancing UI responsiveness.
5. High-End Restaurant Website
Stack: React, Tailwind CSS, Visual Studio Code, JavaScript
Description: A visually appealing, fast, and responsive restaurant website with a component-driven architecture for maintainability and scalability.
